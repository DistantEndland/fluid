# 游랜luid License

游랜luid is intended be a public ruleset. I want you to feel free to use it in your weekly sessions, fork it, modify it, and use it to publish your awesome campaign setting. That being said, I also don't think you should have to give up your rights to your *setting* just because you adopt a certain set of rules. It turns out that this is a pretty complicated problem. It comes down to two tennants:

- A user of 游랜luid should feel confident that they can use the system, and any derived components to do whatever they want.
- A creator should feel confident that using 游랜luid does not impinge upon their inherent rights to their story, their world and their creation.

To make this happen, 游랜luid is organized into layered components and adopts the following licensing conventions.

## 游랜luid Source, Droplets & Mechanics
游랜luid Source, 游랜luid Droplets and all derived mechanics are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). In short, this effectively means you are free to share, adapt and build upon this material without permission for any purpose provided that you provide attribution, including a link to this license, and distribute your contributions under the same license.

This includes all content contained in [source](https://github.com/eschlon/fluid/tree/master/fluid/tiddlers/source/), [droplets](https://github.com/eschlon/fluid/tree/master/fluid/tiddlers/droplets/) and their sub-folders and/or pages prefixed with the 游랜luid (游랜) or Droplet (游랛) icons as well as any new mechanics or primitives that interact with, build off of or derive from another Droplet or Source. This includes existing mechanics or primitives as well as any new ones published for use with the system.

## 游랜luid Streams
游랜luid Streams are copyright (c) their respective creators unless otherwise specified. 

This includes any content clearly marked as such (e.g. in */fluid/tiddlers/streams/*) and/or pages prefixed with the Stream logo (e.g. 游랠 My Awesome Setting) with the exception of any content covered by the above licenses. That is to say a given stream may reference and/or contain new or existing mechanics, droplets, facets or talents or other primitives; however, that rules-related content is **not** considered to be part of the Stream and is covered by the permissive licenses above.

As an example, you can describe a character using the 游랜luid system as part of a closed stream. The character's description, history and appearance are yours; however, any new mechanics or primitives that you develop to describe or play that character are automatically open.

# What It All Means
As a 游랜luid user:

- You are free to use mechanics, Facets and Talents from any source using 游랜luid and use it however you want.
- You are **not** free to use content indicated as a Stream from sources without the content creator's permission.

As creator:

- You are free to define your own permissions for distributing your creative content using 游랜luid as a system.
- You are **not** free to restrict use or access to mechanics or primitives that you define as part of your content.
