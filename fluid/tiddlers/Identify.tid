Your skills at inventing eldritch items makes you adept at identifying the properties of those that you come across. If you have an appropriate eldritch crafting talent (e.g. [[♣ Alchemy]], [[♣ Inscription]]) you may pay ''1x Scholarship'' to identify the properties of any item that your talent would allow you to produce.
