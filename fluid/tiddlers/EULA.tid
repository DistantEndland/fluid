No one likes to be killed by their own legendary magical sword. When crafting an eldritch item you may pay ''1x Scholarship'' to embed a //Property// restricting the use of the item. Restrictions can include that the item is usable only by a specific individual or only in some proscribed manner or that it is ineffective in certain situations.
