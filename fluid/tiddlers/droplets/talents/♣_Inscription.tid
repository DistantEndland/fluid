title: â™£ Inscription
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Scribes acquire and invent patterns to produce scrolls, tablets, tapestries, mandala and other written objects that have magical properties. Patterns always require three components: a stock to take the pattern, an ink to produce the pattern and a pen to inscribe the stock. 

This talent allows the Scribe to invent patterns, fabricate eldritch items from their patterns and utilize inscription equipment to enhance their tests.
