If you fail to perform a //Spell// or //Power// either as a result of failing a test or being interrupted by an outside force, you may pay ''1x Esoteric'' to ground the unformed energy, negating any //Health// or //Composure// damage you may suffer as a result of the failure. If you also possess a //Mastery// in a relevant //Domain// you may additionally reduce the cost of the failed //Spell// or //Power// to 0.
