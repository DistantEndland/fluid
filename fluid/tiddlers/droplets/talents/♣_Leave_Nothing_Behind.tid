If you used [[Plunder]] to take items from a scene, and later find out that you missed some important item (i.e. the non-valuable but handy signet ring, the letter that proves the king's guilt, the crappy carpenter's cup that is actually the holy grail) you may spend ''1x Investigation'' and ''1x Crime'' and explain why you "totally would have taken that" to have the item anyway.
