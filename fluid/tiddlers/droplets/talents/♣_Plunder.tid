Why steal silver when there are diamonds around. You have mastered the sublte art of rapidly appraising and grabbing the most valuable loot given the limitations of how much you can carry and how much time you have before authorities arrive. Spend ''1x Crime'' to loot a scene of any non-hidden valuable items.
