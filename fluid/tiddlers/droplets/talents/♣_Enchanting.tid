Enchanters acquire and invent enchantments to imbue items with magical properties. Enchantments always require three components: the item to enchant, a catalyst for the enchantment and a process to imbue the item. 

This talent allows the Enchanter to invent enchantments, fabricate eldritch items from their enchantments and utilize enchanting equipment to enhance their tests.
