Artificers acquire and invent schema to produce devices, constructs and machines with magical properties. Schema always require three components: a casing to house the device, a specific material to fabricate the device and a focus to power the contraption. 

This talent allows the Artificier to invent schema, fabricate eldritch items from their schema and utilize artificing equipment to enhance their tests.
