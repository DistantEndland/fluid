Accomplishing difficult tasks is easier if you can break them down into small incremental goals. Pay ''1x Labor'' and narrate how you are going to go about accomplishing some goal by breaking it down into two distinct sub-tasks. To succeed in the task you must now make two distinct tests, each against half of the original difficulty. This can only be used for tasks with a static difficulty.
