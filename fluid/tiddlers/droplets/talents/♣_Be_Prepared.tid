You are prepared for any eventuality. Whenever you are faced with a double difficulty penalty due to no appropriate equipment, you may use either pay ''1x Exploration'' and narrate how you are carrying a suitable substitute for exactly this kind of situation or pay ''1x Survival'' and narrate how you once had to do something similar with only your wits and the tools nature provides. In either case you may negate the penalty.
