Miracle workers always multiply their repair estimates. Whenever the GM gives you an estimate of how long it will take to undertake repairs you may spend ''1x Labor'' to cut the estimate in half. If you also have [[♣ Jury Rig]] you may cut the estimate in half again, completing the repairs in a quarter of the time.
