title: â™¥ Disease
type: Deficiency

You have some sort of debilitating disease which should either be determined by discussion with the GM or, if the player wishes, left completely up to the GM. Players should note that diseases acquired in this way are not curable by any normal means. They are defects in the character's genes, and while potentially treatable, will always resurface.
