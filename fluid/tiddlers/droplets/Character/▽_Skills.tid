Characters also have a set of skills that define specific areas in which they have specific training. //Skills// are much more free-form, however generally Fluid works best with a generally fixed set of skills. See the [[ðŸœ„ Skill]], [[ðŸœ„ Fight]] and [[ðŸœ„ Craft]] droplets for a set of fixed skills for general use.

|! Aptitude Rank|! Dice |! Cost to Obtain |! Total Cost |
| Trained | 1d | 1xp | 1xp |
| Capable | 2d | 2xp | 3xp |
| Professional | 3d | 3xp | 6xp |

//Skills// function similarly to //Aptitudes//, having a minimum rank of 0 and a maximum rank of 5. Unlike //Aptitudes//, they are considerably cheaper to advance, though much more specific in their utility. //Skills// are advanced by spending an amount of //Experience// equal to the rank to be gained. See the table for more details.

During play //Skills// are generally paired with an //Aptitude// to determine the total die pool rolled. In general the //Skill// is determined by what you are doing and the //Aptitude// is determined by how you are going about it. In all cases the choice is driven by the narrative.
