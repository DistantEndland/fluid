Characters are represented with a system of six //Aptitudes// which broadly define the general ability of the and are rolled in tandem with a //Skill//. These two types of facets: //Aptitudes//, and //Skills// can all be improved during play directly by spending Experience

The character additionally has a set of three //Reactive Aspects// and three //Passive Aspects// which are derived from the characterâ€™s //Aptitudes// and provide pools of resources that can be used in various situations. Generally, these facets can only be improved indirectly, by improving the underlying //Aptitudes// that contribute to their value.
