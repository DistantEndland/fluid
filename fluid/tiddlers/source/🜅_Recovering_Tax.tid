Taxes can quickly become a problem. Luckily, characters can recover taxed dice in a variety of ways. Talents, spells, powers and just plain old goal-based tests can be used to recover taxes during play. Generally:

* Taxes recover //''quickly when you make an effort to recover them''//

Lukas, exhausted and disturbed manages to flag down a traveling farmer and hitch a ride in his hay wagon to the nearest town. Itâ€™s a bumpy ride but better than walking.
